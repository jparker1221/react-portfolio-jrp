                                    I'm Jon Parker, a full-stack web developer and recent graduate of the UNC-Chapel Hill Coding Bootcamp. I hold a BBA degree in Business from NC State University and have several years of experience working in analytics, media planning and customer service for companies such as Ralph Lauren, MediaHub, and Deweyâ€™s Bakery. After being exposed to web development, I decided to make the switch and am looking forward to a life of learning and building a rewarding career in this industry.

                                    Originally from Mooresville, I currently reside in Winston-Salem, NC with my wife and our Great Dane. In my spare time, I enjoy traveling, cooking, taking in the latest video game graphics, and being front row for some of my favorite bands. I am a passionate musician who has played guitar and bass since I was a teenager, and I currently play bass in a 90s cover band called Red Rope Licorice.
