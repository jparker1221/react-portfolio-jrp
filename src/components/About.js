                                    I'm Jon Parker, a full stack web developer and recent graduate of the UNC-Chapel Hill Coding Bootcamp. I hold a BA in Business Administration from NC State University and have several years of experience working in analytics, media planning, and customer service for companies such as Ralph Lauren, MediaHub, and Deweyâ€™s Bakery. After being exposed to web development, I decided to make the switch and am looking forward to a life of learning and building a rewarding career in this industry.

                                    Originally from Mooresville, NC, I currently reside in Winston-Salem, NC with my wife and our Great Dane. In my spare time, I enjoy traveling, cooking, playing video games, and seeing my favorite bands live. I'm also a passionate musician and have played guitar and bass since I was a teenager. I currently play bass in a 90s cover band called Red Rope Licorice.
